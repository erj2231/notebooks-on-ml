so this file as said before should follow this:
Project Overview
One of the main objectives of this course is to help you gain hands-on experience in communicating insightful  findings to stakeholders. In this project you will use the tools and techniques you learned throughout this course to both find insights and assess the quality of a data set that you feel passionate about.

After going through some guided steps, you will have a data set in great shape, ready for hypothesis testing, and ready for supervised or unsupervised machine learning. You will also produce a report that helps you focus on highlighting your analytical skills and thought process. 

Setup instructions:

Before you begin, you will need to choose a data set that you feel passionate about. You can brainstorm with your peers about great public data sets using the discussion board in this module.

Optional: Find your own data set
As a suggested first step, spend some time finding a data set that you are really passionate about.This can be a data set similar to the data you have available at work or data you have always wanted to analyze. For some people this will be sports data sets, while some other folks prefer to focus on data from a datathon or data for good.

Optional: Participate in a discussion board
As an optional step, go into a discussion board and brainstorm with your peers great data sets to analyze. If you prefer to skip this step, feel free to use the Ames housing data set or the Churn phone data set that we used throughout the course.

Required
Once you have selected a data set, you will produce the deliverables listed below by saving them in  a pdf. Treat this exercise as an opportunity to produce analysis that are ready to highlight your analytical skills for a senior audience, for example, the Chief Data Officer, or the Head of Analytics at your company.

Sections required in your report:

A summary of the data, clearly showing the size of the dataset, its variables, and possible target variables.

A well-structured data exploration plan that is logical, meaningful, and outlines the vision for analysis.

A detailed discussion of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) results that are informative, actionable, and insightful.

 A clear explanation of data cleaning and feature engineering steps, including handling missing values, encoding, and visualizations. The report should also include the output of data cleaning, feature engineering steps, handling missing values, encoding, and visualizations. Relevant screenshots should be included. 

A dedicated section summarizing key findings and insights, effectively synthesizing EDA results in a meaningful and actionable way.

A section that presents at least three hypotheses relevant to the dataset. 

A thorough discussion of a significance test for at least one strong hypothesis. The results or their presentation should be truly insightful and exceed expectations, even if there are slight misinterpretations or room for feedback.

A concluding section that includes key takeaways and next steps.

this is from Coursera so i work hard
